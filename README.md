## **Design**

  ### **Color Scheme**

  -  The color scheme was chosen to look sleak, in an attempt to attract the correct clientelle to the venue. Dark gray's for the text and headings on a white background is readable, and should also be legible for visually imparied users. 

  ### **Typography**

  -  The Lobster font was used for headings on the site and Raleway fonts were used for all of the content. These two fonts were used becasue they complemented each other and suited the image of the venue. Sans-serif was used as a back up font in case the font isn't imported and this font is recognised by all browsers.  

  ### **Imagery**

  - The hero image of the entrance of the venue was used becasue it gives an immediate feel for the venue and shows it's relaxed design. It is very apparent when the site loads and will illicit immediate feelings of comfort to the user.

## **Features to implement**

      - A gallery showcasing the best highlights and events at the venue.
      - An improved booking system, where starting times for the bookings can be selected in 15 minute increments only.

## **Testing**

    Testing was conducted on all mainstream browsers to ensure that they were compatable. The browsers tested were:

      - Google Chrome
      - Safari
      - Microsoft Edge
      - Mozilla Firefox

    Testing was done on various screen sizes and viewports to ensure compatiability across devices, desktop, tablet and phone. This was to ensure that everything was legible and the photos aligned correctly at small sizes. The site was tested on the following phones with no issues:

      - Iphone XR
      - Iphone 12C
      - Iphone 5C
      - Samsung Galaxy A10

      I asked family to test run the website on their phones for futher testing.

     I used [link](http://www.responsinator.com/) which checks the site on a number of mobile screens and tablets (landscape and portrait) including:
     
      - Iphone X
      - Android Pixel 2
      - Iphone 6,7,8
      - Ipad


## **Languages Used**

  * ###  HTML
        - W3C validator was used and ** errors were found
  
  * ###  CSS
        - Jigsaw validator was used and ** errors were found
        
## **Frameworks and Programs Used**

        - Fontawesome - Was used for Social media icons and icons on the 'upcoming events' section.
        - Balsamiq - Was used to design the wireframes for both desktop and phone before coding.
        - Google Fonts - Was used to import the Lobster and Raleway fonts for the site
        - Git - Git was used for version control by commiting to Gitpod and pushing to Github.
        - Github - Is used to store the code

## **Unfixed bugs**

  * On Iphones, the form section that holds the 'Contact Us' and 'Upcoming Events' sections overlap the pizza images. This is something that needs fixing in future versions. Research into some Iphone specfic media queries may solve this issue. 
  The label 'message' for the textarea box on the homepage does not appear at the top of the box, it appears at the bottom.
  * On some mobile devices the gap between the photos and the message/upcoming events section can become larger than desired.

## **Fixed Bugs**

  * Some improvement was made to the alignment of the text in the header from 930px.
  * The book a table heading was fixed to align center, previoulsy this wasn't happening. 

## **Deployment**

The project was deployed to Githib pages in the following way:
1. Logged onto Github and clicked the repository 
2. Clicked the 'Settings' tab
3. Clicked on the 'Pages' tab on the left hand-side 
4. Below the 'Source' label clicked the 'Branch' drop down menu and selected master branch.
5. After a few moments the [link](https://edwardgurney.github.io/pizza-burger-sports-bar/index.html) to the site was published.


## **Credits**

  * Media 
      - Fontawesome was used for soclial media icons, as well as icons on the upcoming events section

      - My images were taken from Instagram from an account for a pub called The Tap and Run in Leicestershire. I felt that the photos were relevant and similar to what I imagined would be served at the venue. I have had permission to use the selected photos. The account can be accesses by going to https://www.instagram.com/tapandruncw/?hl=en

      - I used a Mcdonalds in Nottingham as the location, purely for demonstratable purposes. 


  * Content

      - The hero image was obtained from https://unsplash.com/photos/mynsldMi9dg. The photo was from an artist called Jael Rodriquez

      - To get the map for the contact section of the site I used a blog called authority networks.com that showed how to embed a chosen area on Google maps into your website. The link to the blog with the tutorial was shared with me by a fellow student on Slack. 

      - The website link is: https://authoritynw.com/blog/how-to-add-a-google-map-to-your-website/ and I accessed this on Tuesday 4th May at 8pm. 

      - I spoke with tutor support on Monday 3rd May for assistance in aligning the photots on the site. I was pointed in the direction of grids (my mentor also suggested I look up grids in one of my sessions). I used grids for the photos on the site. 

      - In order to get my 'contact us' section and 'upcoming events' section divs to align next to each other. I used flexbox and I got the information from this training video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE.

      - I had some assistance from student support on sizing the hero image so that it sat better on the homepage

      - I discoverd that using multiple break elements (for my menu section) is bad practice and that you should use '&nbsp' between paragraph elements. I read this on a few webpages but the first one was https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-add-multiple-blank-lines-in-HTML#:~:text=Skipping%20an%20entire%20line%20in,arguably%20not%20a%20best%20practice. (I used a couple of different methods to show vairation, so I also targetted the class="full-menu" with with some line-height in the CSS file).
