## **Credits**

  * Media 
      - Fontawesome was used for soclial media icons, as well as icons on the upcoming events section

      - My images were taken from Instagram from an account for a pub called The Tap and Run in Leicestershire. I felt that the photos were relevant and similar to what I imagined would be served at the venue. The account can be accesses by going to www.instagram.com/******

      - I used a Mcdonalds in Nottingham as the location, purely for demonstratable purposes. 


  * Content

      - To get the map for the contact section of the site I used a blog called authority networks.com that showed how to embed a chosen area on Google maps into your website. The link to the blog with the tutorial was shared with me by a fellow student on Slack. 

      - The website link if you would like to check it is: https://authoritynw.com/blog/how-to-add-a-google-map-to-your-website/ and I accessed this on Tuesday 4th May at 8pm. 

      - I spoke with tutor support on Monday 3rd May for assistance in aligning the photots on the site. I was pointed in the direction of grids (my mentor also suggested I look up grids in one of my sessions). I used grids for the photos on the site. 

      - In order to get my 'contact us' section and 'upcoming events' section divs to align next to each other. I used flexbox and I got the information from this training video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE.

      - I had some assistance fro student support on sizing the hero image so that it sat better on the homepage

      - I discoverd that using multiple <br> (for my menu section) is bad practice and that you should use <p>&nbsp;</p>. I read this on a few webpages but the first one was https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-add-multiple-blank-lines-in-HTML#:~:text=Skipping%20an%20entire%20line%20in,arguably%20not%20a%20best%20practice. (I used a couple of different methods to show vairation, so I also targetted the class="full-menu" with with some line-height in the CSS file).

## **Color Scheme**


  The color scheme was chosen to look sleak, in an attempt to attract the correct clientelle to the venue. Dark gray's for the text and headings on a white background is readable, and should also be legible for visually imparied users.       

## **Wireframes**

  The wireframes can be found in their own folder in the explorer panel or by clicking here.
