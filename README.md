## **Design**

  ### **Color Scheme**

  -  The color scheme was chosen to look sleak, in an attempt to attract the correct clientelle to the venue. Dark gray's for the text and headings on a white background is readable, and should also be legible for visually imparied users. 

  ### **Typography**

  -  The Lobster font was used for headings on the site and Raleway fonts were used for all of the content. These two fonts were used becasue they complemented each other and suited the image of the venue. Sans-serif was used as a back up font in case the font isn't imported and this font is recognised by all browsers.  

  ### **Imagery**

  - The hero image of the entrance of the venue was used becasue it gives an immediate feel for the venue and shows it's relaxed design. It is very apparent when the site loads and will illicit immediate feelings of comfort to the user.

    Describe the process gone through to deploy the project to a hosting platform

## **Credits**

  * Media 
      - Fontawesome was used for soclial media icons, as well as icons on the upcoming events section

      - My images were taken from Instagram from an account for a pub called The Tap and Run in Leicestershire. I felt that the photos were relevant and similar to what I imagined would be served at the venue. The account can be accesses by going to www.instagram.com/******

      - I used a Mcdonalds in Nottingham as the location, purely for demonstratable purposes. 


  * Content

      - To get the map for the contact section of the site I used a blog called authority networks.com that showed how to embed a chosen area on Google maps into your website. The link to the blog with the tutorial was shared with me by a fellow student on Slack. 

      - The website link if you would like to check it is: https://authoritynw.com/blog/how-to-add-a-google-map-to-your-website/ and I accessed this on Tuesday 4th May at 8pm. 

      - I spoke with tutor support on Monday 3rd May for assistance in aligning the photots on the site. I was pointed in the direction of grids (my mentor also suggested I look up grids in one of my sessions). I used grids for the photos on the site. 

      - In order to get my 'contact us' section and 'upcoming events' section divs to align next to each other. I used flexbox and I got the information from this training video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE.

      - I had some assistance fro student support on sizing the hero image so that it sat better on the homepage

      - I discoverd that using multiple <br> (for my menu section) is bad practice and that you should use <p>&nbsp;</p>. I read this on a few webpages but the first one was https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-add-multiple-blank-lines-in-HTML#:~:text=Skipping%20an%20entire%20line%20in,arguably%20not%20a%20best%20practice. (I used a couple of different methods to show vairation, so I also targetted the class="full-menu" with with some line-height in the CSS file).
