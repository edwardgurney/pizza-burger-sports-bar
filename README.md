Pizza and Burger Sports Bar

  This first portfolio project was for a imaginary pizza and burgr sports bar. I felt it would provide a good platfrom of showing what I have learnt on the course so far and could provide some good content over the three pages required. 
  The concept of the website is to provide the information required for anyone looking to visit the bar, they can get the location and address, view the menu, look at upcoming events and also book a table or make contact. The bar is trying to be an upmarket sports bar, so customers can watch sport in nice surroundings, eating nice food and rinking good beer with friends.

UX

  The site was designed to give customers information about the restaurant, booking a table or making contact, how to find the venue and the upcoming events/games that are going to be shown. 

Table of contents 

User stories

  As a visitor to the site I would like the ability to identify where the bar is and contact them via telephone or dirctly through the site. I also want to see the menu before I visit, book a table and see what upcoming sports events are being shown live. End User Goal: To be able to do the previously mentioned. End Business Goal: To maximise familiarity with the bar and to maximise revenue. Acceptance Critieria: To be able to contact the bar and make a booking.

Design

Fraemwork

Color scheme

  The color scheme was chosen to look sleak, in an attempt to attract the correct clientelle to the venue. Dark gray's for the text and headings on a white background is readable, and should also be legible for visually imparied users. 

Wireframes

  The wireframes can be found in their own folder in the explorer panel or by clicking here.

Features of site

  The site is 3 pages of HTML and CSS code. This provides structure to the user and seperates the 3 main functions of the site.

  Users can book tables on the site or contact the bar with requests. 

  The site is fully responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes. 

  Users can access more photos and information for the venuw by following the social media links on the site. 

  The site has been coded in a way to maximise UX for visually impaired users.


Features to implement in future versions

  A gallery showcasing the best highlights and events at the venue


Tech Used 

  HTML was use to construct the basic structure of the site

  CSS was used to add style to the content

  Fontawsome was used for social media icons
  
Testing

  Testing was conducted on all mainstream browsers to ensure that they were compatable as well as on different sized screen dimensions/viewports. 
    Items tested included ensuring that the photos aligned correctly for mobile
    That the site was responsive and everything on the site was eligable at small sizes

  The site was checked on the following browsers:
    Google Chrome
    Internet Explorer/Edge
    Firefox
    Safari

  The site was also tested on 3 phones:
  Iphone XR
  Iphone 12C
  Iphone 5C
  Samsung Galaxy A10


  The site was also tested on W3C & own testing on different viewports etc

Sources

To get the map for the contact section of the site I used a blog called authority networks.com that showed how to embed a chosen area on Google maps into your website. The link was shared with me by a fellow student on Slack. The code provided was for a local burger bar that I chose and the iframe code was: 

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2404.54480121658!2d-1.132143884262!3d52.93861951287327!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4879c3c15579647d%3A0x62474532148ac3e4!2sMcDonald&#39;s%20Trentbridge!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1620155896871!5m2!1sen!2suk" width="1200" height="300" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe>

I changed the width to 100% so that it spanned the screen correctly. 

The website link if you would like to check it is: https://authoritynw.com/blog/how-to-add-a-google-map-to-your-website/ and I accessed this on Tuesday 4th May at 8pm. 

I spoke with tutor support on Monday 3rd May for assistance in aligning the photots on the site. I was pointed in the direction of grids (my mentor also suggested I look up grids in one of my sessions). I used grids for the photos on the site. 

My images were taken from Instagram from an account for a pub called The Tap and Run in Leicestershire. I felt that the photos were relevant and similar to what I imagined would be served at the venue. The account can be accesses by going to www.instagram.com/******

In order to get my 'contact us' section and 'upcoming events' section divs to align next to each other. I used flexbox and I got the information from this training video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE.

As the venue is imaginery, I used a Mcdonalds in Nottingham as the location, purely for demonstratable purposes.

Welcome edwardgurney,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
