        <div class="our-mission">
            <p>
            Our mission is to provide a sports bar that serves award winning food, great beers in a 
            clean environment, somewhere the present day sports fans want to visit, but have for too long 
            had to settle for a dark, dingy pub selling rotten beer.
            </p>
            <br>
        
            <p>
            We are proud of our award winning pizza and burgers and we can’t wait to welcome you. Our staff 
            are friendly and want to make your visit as enjoyable as possible, even if your team loses. 
            So come and join us for a bite to eat and some football, cricket, rugby or beach volleyball.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
            We have an outside dining area fit for all year round, with canopies protecting you from our 
            inclement weather, we have heaters and blankets, perfect for those chilly nights.  
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
            From the outside looking in, you wouldn’t realise that we are a sports bar, some people say they 
            can’t tell when they are sat inside, because before sport starts we serve smashed avocado on toast 
            for breakfast, we like to cater for everyone.
            </p>
